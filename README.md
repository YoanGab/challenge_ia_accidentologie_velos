## About the project
**Project background**  
Today, cycling accounts for only 3% of trips. The [Bicycle Plan](https://www.gouvernement.fr/dossier-de-presse/10511-dossier-de-presse-plan-velo), presented by the Government in September 2018, aims to encourage the development of this mode of travel by removing the main obstacles identified. It thus provides for actions divided into four axes, among which is the improvement of road safety through the development of bicycle facilities. The objective was to reach 55,477 km of safe bicycle facilities (bicycle paths and greenways) by 2022.

**The issue:** 
- To what extent does better bicycle infrastructure reduce bicycle accidents?
- Where should bicycle infrastructure be built to reduce bicycle accidents and improve road safety? ðŸš²

**Project Goals**  
How can we predict the level of danger of the roads according to the layout of the terrain in order to best advise the Mayors on the infrastructures to be installed to reduce the danger?
